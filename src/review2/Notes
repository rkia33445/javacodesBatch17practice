Type Casting:
   Type casting is converting data from one datatype to another datatype.
   For example we can convert an integer to float or other way around.
   There are two types of type casting. Type casting only works with primitive data types.
   1) Implicit/Auto/widening
   2) explicit/Manual/narrowing
Example
int number=(int)10.5
==============================
if statements
 if statements are pert of the condition constructs in java.
the help us write code that can be executed on a condition.
There are many variation of if statements 1) if 2) is-else 3) else-if
4) Nested if
why we need conditional statements ?
     Without the if statement programs will always generate same output
     not matter what.
